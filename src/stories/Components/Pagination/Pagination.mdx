A long list can be divided into several pages using `Pagination`, and only one page will be loaded at a time.

# Basic

The default form of pagination.

<Primary />

# Properties

<Controls />

# Truncation

When the number of pages exceeds the maximum display limit, an ellipsis is used to truncate the remaining pages.
When the current page is separated by more than five pages from both the first and last page, we use double truncation.
