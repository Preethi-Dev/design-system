# Legooo - Getting Started

Welcome to the Legooo React Design System! This guide will help you integrate and use our design system in your React projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the Legooo design system package. You can do this using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/legooo) or Yarn.

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install legooo
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add legooo
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using the components in your React application. Here's a simple example to help you get started.

### Importing Components

Import the components you need from the Legooo design system package.

```javascript
import { Button, Card } from "legooo";
```

## Using Components

Use the imported components in your React component.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is an example of a Card component.</p>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Running Your Application
Run your React application to see the components in action.

**Using npm:**

```bash

npm start
```

**Using Yarn:**

```bash
yarn start
```
